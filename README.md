# **Minimum Wages through Ages:**
### Team Members : Nidhi Gowri Srinath, Aditi Anil Raghuwanshi, Sharat Sindhoor, Pranusha Apuri
A project to understand the changes to the federal, state, and effective minimum wages across the United States. This project aims to visualize the change in wages from the years 1968 to 2020.

The minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid as mandated by federal law. In the United States, states and the federal government set minimum hourly pay or a minimum wage that ensures a  quality of life that its citizens are bound to. Increased minimum wages aid the increase in productivity, company turnovers, and the economy. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may pass different minimum wage requirements provided the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. The decided minimum wage of a state is indicative of the specific state's cost of living. 

Multiple factors influence the selected minimum wage. Some of these include:
<li> Inflation
<li> Gross Regional Domestic Product
<li> Employment Figures
<li> Poverty Threshold

We analyze this data using three visualizations
#### 1. An interactive choropleth map which indicates the average state wages since the past 5 decades across all states.

#### 2. An interactive bar chart and a scatter plot that displays either the state minimum wage, federal minimum wage, or effective minimum wage for a specific year which is chosen by the user.

#### 3. Wage data exploration using a heat map which indicates the trend of specific categories of wages from 1968 to 2020

### Running the code:
  To run the project:
  > <li> Launch an IDE such as Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code </li>
  > <li> Open the folder containing the files 'Minimum_Wage_Statistics.py' and 'min_wage_data.csv' </li>
  > <li> Use the command 'streamlit run pathname' (containing the Minimum_Wage_Statistics.py file) </li>
  > <li> View and interact with the visualizations on the streamlit app in your browser </li>

These visualizations have been deployed as a streamlit app with the help of altair and python.
